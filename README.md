# Power-Saving-in-Backbone-Networks

A system designed to work in a large network. 

My software proposes to save power in backbone networks by hibernating the devices connected in the network when the particular device is idle and is not carrying out any task. 

The system checks all the devices conencted in the network and monitors if a computer is idle, I found, the computer is hibernated and all the new work that is generated for that device will be redirected to live computers in the network by means of an optimised algorithm. The hibernated computer wakes up after a spcific interval and checks for any new work, if some work is available for it, it wakes up and starts working again and its status becomes live again otherwise it again goes into hibernation. 

The load in the network is distributed among the computers using a optimised load balancing technique which ensures that every device is used to its fullest. 

The software is designed using C# and Dot Net.
